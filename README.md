- Art is dead
- Art is dead
- Art is dead
- Art is dead

- Entertainers like to seem complicated
- But we're not complicated
- I can explain it pretty easily
- Have you ever been to a birthday party of children?
- And one of the children
- Won't stop screaming
- Cause he's just a little attention attractor
- When he grows up
- To be a comic or actor
- He'll be rewarded
- For never maturing
- For never- Understanding or learning
- That every day
- Can't be about him
- There's other people
- You selfish asshole

- I must be psychotic
- I must be demented
- To think that I'm worthy
- Of all this attention
- Of all this money, you worked really hard for
- I slept in late while you worked at the drug store
- My drug's attention, I am an addict!
- But I get paid to indulge in my habit
- It's all an illusion,
- I'm wearing make-up
- I'm wearing make-up
- Make-up, make-up, MAKE

- Art is deaad
- So people think you're funny
- How do we get those people's money?
- I said, art is dead
- We're rolling in dough
- While Carlin rolls in his grave,
- His grave, his grave...
- This show has got a budget
- This show has got a budget
- And all the poor people way more deserving the money
- Won't budge it!
- 'Cause I wanted my name in lights
- When i could have fed a family of four
- For forty fucking fortnights
- Forty fucking fortnights

- I am an artist, please God forgive
- I am an artist, please don't revere me
- I am an artist, please don't respect me
- I am an artist, feel free to correct me
- A self-centered artist
- Self-obsessed artist
- I am an artist
- I am an artist
- But I'm just a kid
- I'm just a kid
- I'm just a kid, kid
- And maybe I'll grow out of it.
